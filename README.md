# CNBC Toggler App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User Story

When I was in the MIT Bootcamp, I came across a project that used the useContext() hook. It was a theme toggler app. I thought it was just a normal app, but then I thought, "Why not promote CNBC (First In Business Worldwide)"? 

This app does just that. It uses the current CNBC theme (as of December 11, 2023).
